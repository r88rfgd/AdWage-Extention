# Tab Manager for AdWage

## Overview

**Tab Manager for AdWage** is a browser extension specifically designed to work with [adwage.site](https://adwage.site). It automatically manages the advertisement tabs that open while surfing or auto-surfing on AdWage, eliminating the need for manual tab closing.

- **Proper Credit Time**: Keeps ad tabs open for 15–30 seconds to ensure you receive your coin rewards  
- **Focus Management**: Automatically brings ads into focus as required by AdWage  
- **Toggle On/Off**: Easily disable the extension when not using AdWage  

## Why This Extension Helps

When using AdWage to earn coins, you typically need to:
- View each advertisement for a specific duration

- Manually close the tabs after viewing  

**Tab Manager for AdWage automates all three steps**, making your AdWage experience smoother and less time-consuming.
